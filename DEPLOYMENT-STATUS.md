## 🎯 Problem Fixed

### Before:
```
❌ URL: /blog/chatgpt-5-vs-gpt-4-whats-new-and-why-it-matters
❌ Browser loads: ./assets/index.js (relative)
❌ Resolves to: /blog/assets/index.js
❌ Server returns: 404 or index.html (text/html)
❌ Error: MIME type "text/html" expected "application/javascript"
❌ Result: Blank page with console error
```

### After:
```
✅ URL: /blog/chatgpt-5-vs-gpt-4-whats-new-and-why-it-matters
✅ Browser loads: /assets/index.js (absolute)
✅ Server returns: JavaScript file (application/javascript)
✅ .htaccess routes: /blog/* → index.html
✅ React Router: Renders correct component
✅ Result: Perfect! Page loads and works!
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Asset Path Strategy
- **Method:** Absolute paths from root
- **Implementation:** `base: '/'` in Vite config
- **Result:** `/assets/index.js` works from any route depth

### Routing Strategy
- **Method:** Apache mod_rewrite fallback
- **Implementation:** .htaccess rewrite rules
- **Result:** All routes fallback to index.html

### MIME Type Fix
- **Method:** Explicit MIME type declarations
- **Implementation:** AddType directives in .htaccess
- **Result:** JavaScript files served with correct MIME type

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Simple 3-Step Process:

#### Step 1: Build
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Step 2: Verify (Optional)
```bash
npm run verify
```

Expected output:
```
✅ dist folder exists
✅ index.html exists
✅ Using absolute paths (/assets/)
✅ assets folder exists
✅ .htaccess exists
✅ .htaccess has MIME type definitions
🎉 Build is ready for deployment!
```

#### Step 3: Upload
- Login to cPanel File Manager
- Navigate to `public_html/`
- Upload all files from `dist/` folder
- Verify `.htaccess` is uploaded
